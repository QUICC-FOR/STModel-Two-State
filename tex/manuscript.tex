\section*{Introduction}
\subsection*{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe the range limits at equilibrium of ecologically important trees in eastern North America as predicted by metapopulation theory
	\item Evaluate the relationship between macroclimatic variables and colonization and extinction rates
	\item Test quantitatively whether the equilibrium prediction matches the contemporary observed range
	\item Compare among species the predicted resilience to environmental change 
\end{itemize}

Present and future rapidly changing global environmental conditions are likely to push many species to the limits of their ecological niches.
Biogeographical theory and empirical work suggests that species can respond to these changes by adapting \emph{in situ} to the new conditions, geographically tracking ideal conditions (resulting in range shifts), and/or experiencing local extinction where conditions no longer support presence.
Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly-applied to understand the latter two options.
Classical SDMs often use a bioclimatic modeling approach that statistically relates presence or absence of the species to climate.
Such models are quite powerful when describing the present realized niche of a species, however they suffer from several drawbacks when predicting the future distribution of species, and they provide no insight into the mechanisms underlying a species' response to the environment.
An alternative more mechanistic approach is to examine the colonization rate $c$ of unoccupied patches and the extinction rate $e$ of occupied patches.
(here maybe briefly review the literature on the subject)
In such a stochastic system, the long-term expectation is that presence will only be possible where $c > e$.
It follows that, if these rates vary along an environmental gradient, the equilibrium position of the range limit on the gradient will be the point at which $c = e$.

We designed a colonization-extinction model with a dynamic parameterization that allowed the colonization and extinction rates to vary as a function of climate.
A major challenge to employing these models is the lack of time series data needed to estimate the parameters.
We used a large database of permanent forest plots, containing repeated observations of xxx plots in eastern North America (n=xxx paired observations). 
We selected the 21 most abundant species (based on the number of observations in the database) as the focus of this study.
We performed model selection, using 6 macroclimatic variables, then parameterized the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and addressed the following questions for each selected species:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Are range limits driven by colonization-extinction dynamics?
	\item To what extent are the species studied presently out of equilibrium with the environment?
	\item How resilient are range limits to perturbations in the environment?
	\item Which climatic variables best describe colonization and extinction rates?
\end{enumerate}

%% here expand a bit on each question above and perhaps provide a testable hypothesis.
We evaluated the model by reserving half of the observed sample pairs.
We parameterized the model and performed model selection on the calibration half, then used the parameters to predict the second state as a function of the climate and the first state in the evaluation dataset.
We then compared the predicted to the observed second state and computed TSS and ROC (explanation and citation?).
This evaluation can be interpreted as a test of the model iteself, and thus of the hypothesis that range limits are determined by colonization-extinction dynamics.

To test to what extent species were out of equilibrium with the environment, we employed an independent dataset from the same database.
This dataset consisted of plots that were only sampled once, and thus were not useful in parameterizing the CE model.
We used the posterior predictions from the CE model to compute the probability of presence at equilibrium; we then compared this with observed presences from the dataset and computed TSS and ROC.
For comparison with a highly fit model, we also built an SDM using the Random Forests algorithm and computed the same statistics.
Species that are in equilibrium with their environment will show high coherence between the two models, and thus should have high validation scores in for both the CE and SDM.
Species out of equilibrium should perform poorly for the CE model and better for the SDM.

\begin{itemize}
	\item response of C-E to env variables
	\item validation of models w.r.t. reserved data (how good is the model)
	\item ability of the model to predict the range (equilibrium)
	\item rate of response to disequilibrium
	\item ability of model to predict response to environmental change

\section*{Discussion}

Fisichelli and colleagues reported recruitement of temperate trees into boreal ecosystems, supporting our conclusion that colonization of temperature trees varies as a function of temperature \cite{Fisichelli2014}.



This model enables us to more precisely define the niche in terms of the fundamental processes of colonization and extinction (fig..). 
For example, the response of \emph(Acer saccharum) to temperature suggests that the southern range limit is a consequence of elevated extinction rates, whereas the northern limit is likely determined by low rates of colonization.
The consequence of these two processes, when overlaid, is a range covering intermediate temperatures, bounded by low colonization in the north and high extinction in the south (fig - map).

% can this apply to other organisms? animals prob not - dispersal is just too high
% this deserves a paragraph here
Our model is particularly appropriate for forest trees, which are sessile, disperse relatively short distances, and are long-lived. 
Unique challenges confront applying such a model without these characteristics, such as most animals. 
Animals in highly patchy environments, with local populations linked by moderate dispersal rates, are likely to be the most appropriate species for use with our model.

\subsection*{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Range limits of [some/many/most/all] [temperate/boreal] tree species in northeastern north America are determined by colonization-extinction dynamics
	\item Moisture and energy (i.e., mean annual temperature and precipitation) are associated with colonization and extinction rates for many species
	\item For some species, the equilibrium state of the model did not match the predicted distribution of the species, suggesting that these species are either out of equilibrium with the environment, or that other processes (e.g., large-scale disturbances) contribute to their range dynamics.
	\item Resilience (represented by the dominant eigenvalue (c - e) near the transition point) varies widely among species, suggesting greatly differential rates of response to environmental change.
	\item Validation? Model Selection?

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Model description}

\subsection*{Prevalence model}
We used the RF package in R to build models of regional prevalence for each species. 
For predictors, we initially evaluated a set of xx environmental variables. 
From these, we selected xx variables that were relatively uncorrelated to each other (pairwise Pearson correlation < xx) and that had high loadings in a principal components analysis (PCA) of all variables. 
In this way, we reduced the risk of estimation problems due to correlations among the predictors while retaining variables that were representative of the available climatic space.

\subsection*{Model selection}
For each species, we evaluated a set of 145 colonization-extinction models. 
Each model consisted of at most two environmental variables, one associated with temperature and the other precipitation\. 
The model set was constructed from eight possible model forms (Table?) applied to all possible two-variable combinations of the four energy and four moisture variables (i.e., 16 possible variable combinations), along with two additional single-variable forms for each variable and an intercept-only model. 
Because of the large number of models, fitting all models using MCMC was infeasible; therefore, we performed model selection by computing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) on maximum likelihood estimates for each model, fit using simulated annealing (package GenSA in R). 
We then selected the model that minimized AIC for final parameterization.

\subsection*{Parameterization}
We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler employing a Metropolis-Hastings scheme to estimate posterior distributions for all parameters.
This method has a number of advantages over the simulated annealing approach used for preliminary model selection.
First, MCMC results in full joint posterior distributions of the parameters, allowing for a robust understanding of the uncertainty both in model parameters and predictions.
Second, the use of a Bayesian framework allows the inclusion of prior information.
As our parameters were all estimated on the logit scale, we used the weakly informative Cauchy priors suggested by (cite Gelman paper), with a mean of 0 and (variance?) of 10 for intercept parameters or 2.5 for slope parameters.
Finally, having posterior distributions of the predictors allows for the information produced by our model to be incorporated in future meta-modeling efforts that can further improve our characterization of species' ranges and our understanding of model uncertainty (cite GEB paper).

For each species, we obtained xxx posterior samples...
We assessed convergence...
