coding for interval censoring:
	time: the initial observation year
	time2: the repeat observation year
	event=
		0: left censored - dead at time2, unknown time (used for trees that have only a dead observation)
				time=NA, time2=year dead
		1: tree was alive at time and dead at time2 (trees with a repeat OR with an initial presence and then gone by time2)
				time=year alive, time2 = year dead
		2: right censored - alive at time2, unknown time (trees where they weren't observed at time but were present at time2)
				time=NA, time2=year alive
		3: interval censored - alive at both time periods
				time=first year alive, time2=second year alive
		
Surv(time, time2, event, type='interval')
